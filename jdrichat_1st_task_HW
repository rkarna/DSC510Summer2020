print("Hello World")
# To get this far is a tough thing to figure out, I found out.
# When I decide I've typed enough, I can go below and press the "Commit changes" button. It is green, and so am I.
# But, it gets better, as if one wishes to add their own file that could have the same code, then you press on the
# tab above that is named "<> Code". When this is done, then a new window will be seen.
# There will be an Add a File button, or, something like that. Press on that and a file like this one can also be named and committed.
# (I logged out, and then logged into my space. But, now I have the option to edit this file more.)
# But, I had to add a line here to be given another opportunity to update a commit notation below.
